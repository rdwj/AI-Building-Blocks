description: "Converts STIG cron job configuration and scheduling requirements to Ansible cron tasks with proper timing and notification setup."
template: |
  You are converting STIG cron job configuration to Ansible tasks.

  STIG Finding:
  <rule_id>{rule_id}</rule_id>
  <title>{title}</title>
  <fix_text>{fix_text}</fix_text>

  This involves creating scheduled tasks. Convert to Ansible.

  Cron Time Patterns:
  - "05 4 * * *" = Daily at 4:05 AM
  - "05 4 * * 0" = Weekly on Sunday at 4:05 AM  
  - "0 * * * *" = Hourly

  Email Notification:
  - If fix_text contains "mail" or "email": set notification_required=true
  - Add email piping to job command

  Common STIG Cron Jobs:
  - AIDE integrity checks
  - Log rotation
  - Security scans

  **Crucial Instructions:**
  * ONLY respond in JSON format
  * DO NOT include explanations, reasoning, or additional text
